# chip8

TUI CHIP-8 interpreter I am writing to learn Rust.
Based on [this guide](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/) by Tobias Langhoff.

## Building

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Nikoof/chip8
$ cd chip8
$ cargo build
$ cargo run
```

Only tested it on Linux but in theory it should compile and work on all platforms.
